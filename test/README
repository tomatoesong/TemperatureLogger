## TESTING
Due to the lack of physical devices to perform testing only rudimentary value injection to some functions were tested. Without having written an I2C simulation that works like a TwoWire Object with injected data
it is hard to do any integration testing. With the time contraint and type of exercise this project is it was impractical to create a test suite.

## TMP100
* Tested with provided values from data sheet of MSB: 0xE7 and LSB: 0x00 which corresponds to -25.0000 C.
* All functions returned the correct temperature and raw values

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.
